A Travoloca agent wishes to create a database for its customer airline booking.
- A customer can call into, or contact by telephone, or online browse, and book a flight.
- Customer information includes National ID or Passport Number, Name, Lastname, Phone
number, E-mail address.
- Flight information includes a unique transaction number, a flight number, a flight
itinerary(departure date, time & airport; destination date, time & airport), and fare.
- A round-trip is recoded as two separate flights.
- Once the Travoloca has found a suitable plan for a customer, the flight requirements are reserved
for the customer. However, the reservation can only be held for up to 24 hours by which time the
customer must accept or decline the booking.
- The customer must pay the invoice in full by cash or by providing credit card information,
a minimum of four weeks before the departure date.
- The name and ID of the salesperson who initially processes the customer booking is recorded
